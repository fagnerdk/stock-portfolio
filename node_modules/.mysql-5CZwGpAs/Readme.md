## Install

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Node.js 0.6 or higher is required.

Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install mysql
```

For information about the previous 0.9.x releases, visit the [v0.9 branch][].

Sometimes I may also ask you to install the latest version from Github to check
if a bugfix is working. In this case, please do:

```sh
$ npm install mysqljs/mysql
```

[v0.9 branch]: https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/tree/v0.9

## Introduction

This is a node.js driver for mysql. It is written in JavaScript, does not
require compiling, and is 100% MIT licensed.

Here is an example on how to use it:

```js
var mysql      = require('mysql');
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host     : 'localhost',
  user     : 'me',
  password : 'secret',
  database : 'my_db'
});

connection.connect();

connection.query('SELECT 1 + 1 AS solution', function (error, results, fields) {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log('The solution is: ', results[0].solution);
});

connection.end();
```

From this example, you can learn the following:

* Every method you invoke on a connection is queued and executed in sequence.
* Closing the connection is done using `end()` which makes sure all remaining
  queries are executed before sending a quit packet to the mysql server.

## Establishing connections

The recommended way to establish a connection is this:

```js
var mysql      = require('mysql');
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host     : 'example.org',
  user     : 'bob',
  password : 'secret'
});

connection.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error('error connecting: ' + err.stack);
    return;
  }

  console.log('connected as id ' + connection.threadId);
});
```

However, a connection can also be implicitly established by invoking a query:

```js
var mysql      = require('mysql');
var connection = mysql.createConnection(...);

connection.query('SELECT 1', function (error, results, fields) {
  if (error) throw error;
  // connected!
});
```

Depending on how you like to handle your errors, either method may be
appropriate. Any type of connection error (handshake or network) is considered
a fatal error, see the [Error Handling](#error-handling) section for more
information.

## Connection options

When establishing a connection, you can set the following options:

* `host`: The hostname of the database you are connecting to. (Default:
  `localhost`)
* `port`: The port number to connect to. (Default: `3306`)
* `localAddress`: The source IP address to use for TCP connection. (Optional)
* `socketPath`: The path to a unix domain socket to connect to. When used `host`
  and `port` are ignored.
* `user`: The MySQL user to authenticate as.
* `password`: The password of that MySQL user.
* `database`: Name of the database to use for this connection (Optional).
* `charset`: The charset for the connection. This is called "collation" in the SQL-level
  of MySQL (like `utf8_general_ci`). If a SQL-level charset is specified (like `utf8mb4`)
  then the default collation for that charset is used. (Default: `'UTF8_GENERAL_CI'`)
* `timezone`: The timezone configured on the MySQL server. This is used to type cast server date
